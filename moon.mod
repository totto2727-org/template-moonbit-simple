// Leave both settings unset for synchronous, backend-neutral libraries.

// For async libraries, uncomment supported_targets and exactly one
// preferred_target. Choose the first viable preferred target in this order:
// wasm, js, native. If a dependency supports fewer targets, narrow both
// settings to match that dependency.
